  Luis Lionel Andres (“Leo”) Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina 
  national team. At the age of 13, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his medical treatments. 
  There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping his club win more than two dozen league titles 
  and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2019, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner
  for the sixth time.

  Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer 
  with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys,
  a Rosario-based club.
  Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone 
  deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections 
  for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication. 
  So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have 
  his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he 
  was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.
  Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has drawn comparisons to 
  another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.

  By the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for the FC Barcelona, putting himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as 
  the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise. That same year, he led Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup, 
  scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria.
  Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in 2009, when the left-footer's team captured the Champions League, La 
  Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home his first FIFA "World Player 
  of the Year" honor/Ballon d'Or award.
  Even the great Maradona gushed about his fellow countryman. "I see him as very similar to me," the retired player told the BBC. "He's 
  a leader and is offering lessons in beautiful football. He has something different than any other player in the world."
  Amazingly, the soccer wizard continued to improve, discovering new ways to elude defenders while leading Barcelona to La Liga and 
  Spanish Super Cup championships in 2010 and 2011, as well as the '11 Champions League title.
  Messi embarked on an all-out assault on the record books in 2012. He became the first player to score five goals in a Champions League 
  match in early March, and a few weeks later he surpassed Cesar Rodriguez's club-record 232 goals to become Barcelona's all-time leading 
  scorer. 
  By the end of 2012, Messi had accumulated an astounding 91 goals in club and international play, eclipsing the 85 netted in a single 
  calendar year by Gerd Muller in 1972. Fittingly, he broke another record when he was named the FIFA Ballon d'Or winner for the fourth 
  time in January 2013.
